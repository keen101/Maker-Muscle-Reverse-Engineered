# Maker Muscle Reverse Engineered
These are the files for my version of the Maker Muscle Linear Actuator (http://makermuscle.com/). Meant to be an open source project, but the source files were never released. Also seems to be yet abother failed kickstarter project (https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/deezmaker/maker-muscle-worlds-first-customizable-actuator-fo) that stole peoples money. :( Sad.

no traction on Hackaday.io either (https://hackaday.io/project/20886-open-actuator-system-maker-muscle) :( :(

So i reverse engineered them to the best of my ability. I will probably keep working on this in the near future.

I plan on making the drive nut have a 3d printable thread in it soon.

an alternate version using 80/20 brand t-slot is drafted up as well.

Enjoy. And feel free to fork this project and keep improving it yourself!
