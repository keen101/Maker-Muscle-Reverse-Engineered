# Maker Muscle Reverse Engineered
These are the files for my version of the Maker Muscle Linear Actuator. Meant to be an open source project, but the source files were never released. Also seems to be yet abother failed kickstarter project that stole peoples money. :( Sad.

So i reverse engineered them to the best of my ability. I will probably keep working on this in the near future.

I plan on making the drive nut have a 3d printable thread in it soon.

an alternate version using 80/20 brand t-slot is drafted up as well.

Enjoy. And feel free to fork this project and keep improving it yourself!
